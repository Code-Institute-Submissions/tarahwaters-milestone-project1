# Summit Careers ðŸš€ 

This is an existing website run by my friend which advertises the career counselling services offered by [**Summit Careers**](https://www.careerswithsummit.com). Since the website is due to be refurbished and updated soon, I spoke with the Founder of Summit Careers and offered to design a potential new look for the page.
