# Summit Careers ðŸš€ 

This is an existing website run by my friend which advertises the admissions consulting services offered by [**Summit Careers**](https://www.careerswithsummit.com). Since the website is due to be refurbished and updated soon, I spoke with the Founder of Summit Careers and offered to design a potential new look for the page.

The purpose of the website is to attract prospective MBA and Masters students seeking guidance and support while applying for their dream college or university abroad. The key aims are to give details of the company services and encourage users to submit their details for more information / to schedule a meeting with the team.

### Business Vision

Taking the exisiting website and its functionality, but attempting to **improve on the consistency of the design** to make it easier and quicker for customers to sign up. 

A **business-to-consumer (B2C)** audience is targeted so the content and visual layout needs to be simple, clear and engaging, while still keeping in line with the minimalist and modern feel of the original site.

A **Chrome DevTools Lighthouse** audit for the current website shows a **poor performance rating of 45%** which could be improved by some of the following measures:

- Reduce unused JavaScript and CSS to improve page load speed by **focusing on basic functionality** without the excessive features
- Ensuring the **visibility of text during webfront loading** by temporarily showing a system font or preloading fonts to increase loading speed (if still applicable)

## Trade Offs

The table below shows the features that should be implemented to make an appealing and functional website for users. Due to time constraints and my current skill level, some of these features are not implemented at this stage.

## Scope

New website features to be included in this project:

- New logo and design consistent throughout website
- Contact form accessible on each page with the option to sign up for the Base Camp newsletter
- Reviews organised in a compact, clickable gallery (for mobile) / carousel

## Structure

The website consists of 5 pages (Home, About Us, Study Abroad, Reviews and Contact Us).
The pages are laid out logically so users can predict where to find thei information they need.
A contact form is avaiable at the bottom of each page to increase sign up. 

**Home** - 
There is a hero image with a brief description of the website and a strong message of company success rates. Reviews are a main focus underneath this, along with an inspiring message and a contact form.

**About Us** - 
Team member details and images are displayed. Contact form at the bottom of the page.

**Study Abroad** -
Description of the Summit consulting process along with logos of university / colleges (with links) that Summit has worked with. A selection of student reviews are also included, along with a contact form.

**Reviews** -
A gallery page of positive reviews. Contact form at the bottom.

**Contact Us** -
A separate page for the contact form only (in case the user jumps straight here from the nav bar).

**Header and Footers** -
All pages will include the same header and footer for consistency. The mobile and tablet versions will have a more basic design, with only the logo and menu icon in the corner for simplicity. Company details, copyright and social media links will be available on the footers.

## Surface

### Colour Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour palette for the design.

I designed a new logo to also match with the themes. These were the initial colour palettes used.

![Summit website colour palettes](/documentation/readme/summit-colour-schemes.jpg "Summit website colour palettes")

Then an alternative was tested after DevTools suggested a more user friendly contrast in colors -

### Typography

[fontjoy.com](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to create aesthetic font pairings for the webpage.

- **Alegreya Sans SC**
- **Raleway**
- **Hind Madurai**
- with a backup font of **"Sans serif"**

### Content

**Navbar** from [Bootstrap or BS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/#responsive-behaviors) 
- adjusted bg color and added brand/logo with homepage link, moved menu items across to the right side for better UI.
- **@Nathan Parry_4P_cohort_lead** and **@Paul Treggiden** (see References for contact links) helped fix issues with styling.

**Footer** - used code from Code Institute (CI) Love Running tutorial as a reference, then adapted styling for page and used bootstrap columns to separate text and social links.
- Issues with responsiveness and text-alignment within the columns for larger screens, so contacted CI tutor support to help with this. Solution found using BS class of 'my-auto' to add auto top and bottom margins to each column which helped to center the content.
- Footer design for mobile devices was simplified using a different set of code (logo and social links only displayed using a BS row) hidden for larger screens using the 'd-lg-none' BS class.

**Hero image carousel** from [BS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/#with-indicators).
- Help with carousel slides initially not showing up - [ByteGrad on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZLxhgTKCU).
- Suggestions on how to crop height of carousel heroimage3.jpg after successfully targeting in CSS - [linuxhint](https://linuxhint.com/how-to-crop-an-image-using-css/).
Tutor support to fix hero image alignment problem - **@Paul Treggiden** identified that the problem was that the image aspect ratio was different to the others (using an aspect ratio calculator), and helped me adjust my image to a 3x2 ratio that now works well.

**Cover-text / hero image text overlay** 
- Initial code attempted using CI Love Running tutorial, adapted for personal styling.
- Then additional help sought from [stackoverlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62550170/how-to-customize-the-bootstrap-carousel-to-have-some-text-static-and-some-chang) to add text within BS image carousel (since initial styling and responsiveness with a separate text overlay seemed too complicated).

**Company-summary Section** - used code from 'club-ethos' section of CI Love Running tutorial as a reference to have a header with two boxes of content underneath (for large screens), along with media query to help make the page responsive (e.g. collapsing to a single column).
- Issues with responsive styling of the two adjacent boxes (particularly with resizing the image but keeping aspect:ratio) so contacted CI tutor support for assistance. They recommended using a **'flexbox'** and this link was helpful in understanding the concept: [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/.).
- Then had further issues with the media query to account for the flexbox, which tutor support helped with again using the **'flex-direction' property** -  [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) and then **ordering the flex items** was important too - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items).

**Bootstrap buttons** - from [BS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/).
- CI CV Project tutorial was used to help with overriding BS button styling to match website colour scheme.
- [Testbook](https://testbook.com/web-development/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link) helped fix the link for the 'Get in touch' button so it redirects to the contact-form section towards the bottom of the page.

**Review Section** - another carousel was used from [BS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/carousel/#dark-variant) code, this time a dark variant (so that the indicators would be more visible) with slide labels for the review quotes. 
- The carousel worked well for mobile devices with just one review visible at a time, and the option to tap or scroll across to see more. However, it felt more appropriate to have all the reviews spread acrosss the page on larger screens.
- Former CI student, [Toto Kotaro Tanaka's School of English page](https://toto-kotaro-tanaka.github.io/ms1-school-of-english/index.html) and [github repository](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms1-school-of-english) submitted for their MS1 project helped me massively in trying to figure out the structure and styling needed for the larger layout. Their code was used as a template which was then adapted and styled along with [BS documentation guidance on the grid system using column classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/).
- [SlackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14977392/bootstrap-carousel-remove-auto-slide) provided support for stopping the auto scroll of slides for BS carousels.
- @Paul Treggiden explain the 'display:block' function in CSS and how it could be used to centralise the review images, since it will then take up the entire space of the container it is in.

**Contact-form Section** - adapted code initially from CI CV and Love Running project tutorials.
- Used [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel) for help with understanding **input type="tel"** properties for the contact form.
- When adding labels to the contact form, the structure became distorted and less uniform so decided to add in some [BS form elements](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/) for easier responsive styling.
- [SlackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31873595/keep-label-and-auto-sizing-input-on-the-same-line) was used to help adjust the visual layout of the name inputs, so that on larger screens the first name and last name inputs could share a row. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) gave further insight into the potential use of **flex-direction**, along with troubleshooting help from cohort peer, **@Paul Treggiden**.

**About Page** - styles utilised from homepage and structure for 'Team and Advisor Board' sections based on code used for 'Review' section (adapted BS column layout to emphasise top two team members in the larger screen layout).
