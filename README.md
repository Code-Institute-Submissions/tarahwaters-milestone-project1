# Summit Careers ðŸš€ 

This is an existing website run by my friend which advertises the admissions consulting services offered by [**Summit Careers**](https://www.careerswithsummit.com). Since the website is due to be refurbished and updated soon, I spoke with the Founder of Summit Careers and offered to design a potential new look for the page.

The purpose of the website is to attract prospective MBA and Masters students seeking guidance and support while applying for their dream college or university abroad. The key aims are to give details of the company services and encourage users to submit their details for more information / to schedule a meeting with the team.

### Business Vision

Taking the exisiting website and its functionality, but attempting to **improve on the consistency of the design** to make it easier and quicker for customers to sign up. 

A **business-to-consumer (B2C)** audience is targeted so the content and visual layout needs to be simple, clear and engaging, while still keeping in line with the minimalist and modern feel of the original site.

A **Chrome DevTools Lighthouse** audit for the current website shows a **poor performance rating of 45%** which could be improved by some of the following measures:

- Reduce unused JavaScript and CSS to improve page load speed by **focusing on basic functionality** without the excessive features
- Ensuring the **visibility of text during webfront loading** by temporarily showing a system font or preloading fonts to increase loading speed (if still applicable)

## Trade Offs

The table below shows the features that should be implemented to make an appealing and functional website for users. Due to time constraints and my current skill level, some of these features are not implemented at this stage.

## Scope

New website features to be included in this project:

- New logo and design consistent throughout website
- Contact form accessible on each page with the option to sign up for the Base Camp newsletter
- Reviews organised in a compact, clickable gallery (for mobile) / carousel

## Structure

The website consists of 5 pages (Home, About Us, Study Abroad, Reviews and Contact Us).
The pages are laid out logically so users can predict where to find thei information they need.
A contact form is avaiable at the bottom of each page to increase sign up. 

**Home** - 
There is a hero image with a brief description of the website and a strong message of company success rates. Reviews are a main focus underneath this, along with an inspiring message and a contact form.

**About Us** - 
Team member details and images are displayed. Contact form at the bottom of the page.

**Study Abroad** -
Description of the Summit consulting process along with logos of university / colleges (with links) that Summit has worked with. A selection of student reviews are also included, along with a contact form.

**Reviews** -
A gallery page of positive reviews. Contact form at the bottom.

**Contact Us** -
A separate page for the contact form only (in case the user jumps straight here from the nav bar).

**Header and Footers** -
All pages will include the same header and footer for consistency. The mobile and tablet versions will have a more basic design, with only the logo and menu icon in the corner for simplicity. Company details, copyright and social media links will be available on the footers.

### Colour Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour palette for the design.

I designed a new logo to also match with the themes (will choose one).
