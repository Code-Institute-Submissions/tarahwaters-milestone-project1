# Summit Careers ðŸš€ 

This is an existing website run by my friend which advertises the admissions consulting services offered by [**Summit Careers**](https://www.careerswithsummit.com). Since the website is due to be refurbished and updated soon, I spoke with the Founder of Summit Careers and offered to design a potential new look for the page.

The purpose of the website is to attract prospective MBA and Masters students seeking guidance and support while applying for their dream college or university abroad. The key aims are to give details of the company services and encourage users to submit their details for more information / to schedule a meeting with the team.
